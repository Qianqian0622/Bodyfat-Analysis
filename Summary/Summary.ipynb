    "The body fat percentage (BFP) of a human or other living being is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass, multiplied by 100. It is a measure of fitness level. While the body fat percentage plays an important role in various health outcomes such as life expectancy, healthcare costs and the so on, it is quite difficult and costly to calculate. So it is practical to come up with a simple and accurate method to estimate body fat percentage. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use multiple regression to determine the prediction equations for the determination of body fat percentage. The data set we used to analyze contains age, weight, height and 10 circumference measurements on 252 men. Each man's percentage of body fat was accurately estimated by an underwater weighing technique."

    "Firstly, we look through the summary statistics of all variables. We found that there are some abnormal observations. The body fat of observation 182 is 0 which must be an error and this could be handled by computing from the Siri's formula, which should be -3.6. Since there may exist an record error, we decide to delete it. The density of observation 216 is 0.995 smaller than the density of water. Since we do not use density and the other features are normal, we just keep this observation. The height of observation 42 is 29.50 which is so small, but the other features seem quite normal. We consider to impute it by BMI calculation, which should be 69.50. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we fit the linear regression with all observations and then use Cook‚Äôs distance to find the influential points of the model. From the Cook's distance plot, we identify observation 39 is obvious influential point. The subject weights 363 pounds which is very abnormal and all the other features are also quite big, for instance the hip, chest, abdomen circumstances. Then, we consider to delete it. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the data cleaning, we draw an influence plot. According to the influence plot, the studentized residuals are in the range [-3,3] and the hat values are small. There are no obvious outliers and influential points. Hence we could do next step to construct the linear regression model."

    "factor is greater than 1, then there might exist multicollinearity. For each inflation factor VIF , if it‚Äôs \n",

From the table of VIF s shown above, we could identify the individual factor VIF of WEIGHT, HEIGHT and ADIPOSITY are much greater than 10, which indicates that multicollinearity may have a large impact on the inference."

The $R^2$ criterion, adjusted R^2 criterion, Mallow‚Äôs $C_p$ criterion, BIC/AIC criterion. The smaller Cp,BIC/AIC and the bigger adjusted $R^2$ criterion and $R^2$, the better the performance of the model fitting.\n",

Based on the \"rugsubset\" function, the model is BODYFAT~ WEIGHT+ABDOMEN."

    "\n",
    "Then I use the \"step\" function in R and BIC criterion.The reason that I choose BIC criterion is that AIC will tend to overfitting. The direction of this process is ‚Äúboth‚Äù instead of exhaustive search we implemented before, which means we either add or delete the explanatory variable and compare BIC among them and choose the smallest BIC to gain the best model fitting explanatory variables. The result after a number of steps of choosing is BODYFAT ~ AGE + ADIPOSITY + CHEST + ABDOMEN + WRIST. "
